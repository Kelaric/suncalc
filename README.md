# suncalc

This is a vue application for calculating extraterrestrial radiation. Some more calculations will be added in a future. This app was just a 3h self-made application. I was inspired by the reason there was no such calculator over the internet yet and that I used pysolar (https://pysolar.org/) for my calculations. This fills the gap.
